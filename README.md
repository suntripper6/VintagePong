# VintagePong

Based on the classic game.

HTML/CSS/JS game - no API calls at this time.
User presented with 3 buttons (for speed): ["Easy", "Medium", "Hard"].
Each button (["Easy", "Medium", "Hard"]) will start gameplay.
["Easy"] button will move the pong at a slow rate.
["Medium"] button will move the pong at a faster rate than slow, but slower than ["Hard"].
["Hard"] button will move the pong at a very fast rate..
Interface will reflect, through CSS, a clasic TV screen from the late 1970's.
Gameboard will be divided up; middle divider has no logic functions - purely aesthetic.
Player 1, left, will be a human.
Player 2, right, will be the computer.
Player 1 will have a paddle that will move with the mouse.
Player 2 will have a paddle that will be automated.
Scores for both players will initialize at 0.
Player 1 left will have individual score - left side.
Player 2 right will have individual score - right side.
Each of the Player's score will be accumulated until Stop button is clicked.
Each of the Player's score will be determined when the pong is not hit by the other Player and hits the border.
Each of the Player's score++ will increment by 1.
When button is clicked, the score, if any, reverts to 0's for both players.
When button is clicked a sound will be played.
